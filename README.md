# ksp-arduino-controller

An Arduino controller for Kerbal Space Program. Uses [Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io/) and [krpc-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/krpc-node). To get started, you will need a specific version of the [KRPC](https://krpc.github.io) mod for krpc-node to work, see [krpc-nodes npm page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/krpc-node) for download instructions. 

Wire up the controller as shown in the [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org) diagram below, plug the arduino into the host via USB and type the following commands after cloning to get started. 

```
npm install
npm start
```

I will update the diagram below soon. I promise.
